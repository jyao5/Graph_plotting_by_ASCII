Overview
A class "Graph" to read in graph.dat and store the graph
A class "Image" to draw and store a matrix graph based on the "Graph"
A class, "Path", of array of class "Graph", where each graph contains the minimal spanning tree of one node

Structure:
Graph:
	a matrix to store the DCG
	meta data:node quantity, edge quantity, max indegree, max outdegree
Image:
	a matrix to store matrix that can be readily mapped into the console
	dimension of the matrix
	utility(density) of the matrix
Path;
	an array of inherited graphs "indexed" by each node

Interfaces:
1. Graph should provide a list of nodes to initilize the dimension of the bitmap size in the Image
2. Graph should provide a list of arcs(of a specific type) to Image to draw things on the bitmap
3. Graph should be able to read a "graph.dat" file for initialization
4. Original Graph should should be available to Path to compute list spanning Graph of each node
5. Image should be able to print its content to the console
6. Path should be able to print its "chart" to the console
