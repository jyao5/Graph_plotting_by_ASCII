1.format and type
	matrix in Graph is implemented with vector
	declare: vector<vector<int>> vec;

	(int) #of nodes; #of edges;

2.behaviour
	2.0 getter of metadata
	2.1 initialize matrix by graph.dat, set respective
	2.2 provide a vector<int> of node number for Image's node plotting
	2.3 provide a vector<arc> for Image's arc plotting
	2.5 accessor(read-only) of matrix for Path for shortest path computation
	2.6 print() the matrix for testing
Note: arc is a struct containing: int fromNode#, int toNode#, int weight;

3.algorithm layout
	2.1 read each line, parse the line using stringstream, first number is row number
		following pair is the column number along with the weight
	2.2 traverse the matrix, build the vector by utility of algorithm find()
	2.3 if an element is not zero, extract{row number = from, column number = to, weight}, construct arc
		and push it into vector
