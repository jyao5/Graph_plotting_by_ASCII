1.format and type
	matrix in Graph is implemented with vector
	declare: vector<vector<int>> vec;

	(int) #of nodes

2.behaviour
	2.0 getter of metadata
	2.1 initialize matrix by graph.dat, set respective data member
	2.2 provide a map<string, int> to map node name to storage location
	2.3 provide a vector<arc> for Image's arc plotting
	2.5 accessor(read-only) of matrix for Path for shortest path computation
	2.6 print() the matrix for testing
Note: arc is a struct containing: string fromNode#, string toNode#, int weight;

3.algorithm layout
	2.1 read each line, parse the line using stringstream, first number is row number
		following pair is the column number along with the weight
	2.2 when adding new node to the matrix, store its name-location correspondence
	2.3 if an element is not zero, extract{row number = from, column number = to, weight}, construct arc
		and push it into vector
