1.Conventional width of a console window is estimated as 60
2.input file name "graph.dat""
3.input format is node# [space] dst-node# [space] weight dst-node# [space] weight
4.output two things: (1)ascii image of the graph (2)shortest path chart for each node to other nodes
5.ascii image:
  1)legend:
  -			horizontal line
  |			vertical line
  +			intersection, 90 degrees bend
  =			cross over
  <>^V		arrows
  []		node # in the bracket
  naked#	weight
  2)misc:
  weight should be plugged where unambiguous
  indegree + outdegree = 4 for all nodes
6.chart:
  for each node s, display shortest paths from it to all reachable node t

7.Sample input from "graph.dat":
1 2 10 3 5 4 100
2 1 5
4 3 50 2 10
