1.Type and structure
  for bitmap matrix, using vector<vector<char>>
  (int) row# and column#
  (double)utility
  
2.behaviour
  2.1.initialize the bitmap with node set from Graph.
      assume the console is 70 characters wide.
      place each node in the median column, 7 rows away from each other
      push each node along with its coordinates(as in a struct"node") in a vector
      *note: struct node is of form: (int) node#; (int) rows; (int) columns
  2.2.draw directed lines with the arc set from Graph
      arc pointing out from one node, stem from left and right side of a node
      arc to one node, pointes to up and down side of the node
      In detail, for one node
        incoming arc from above, points to the top
        incoming arc from down , pintes to the bottom
        outgoing arc to above, sprouts from left
        outgoing arc to below, sprouts from right
        TBC
